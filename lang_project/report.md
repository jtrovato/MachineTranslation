Language research project on Thai
=================================

Syntax and morphology
---------------------

The canonical word order in Thai is Subject-Verb-Object, as in English, and word order is generally quite fixed. As in languages like Spanish, the subject in Thai is often omitted when it is understood. There are also a number of classes of marker words, some optional, which can appear within a sentence, although these markers must appear at specific positions relative to the words they modify.

Overall, Thai has very little inflectional morphology. Neither nouns nor verbs inflect for case, gender, number, tense, or mood. Instead, the information conveyed by morphology in a language like English or a Romance language can be contained in features like measure words and in special, optional markers for verb tenses and the like. Since there is no distinction between singular and plural nouns, some specific nouns can be repeated to convey that they are being used in a plural sense; also, measure words are almost always used in noun phrases. Since Thai is also a tonal language, I imagine some information that is lacking in morphology is also conveyed through pitch.

In contrast to morphology, there is a rich collection of pronouns for different grammatical persons and for various levels of formality; in particular, there are specialized pronouns used to refer to royalty, clergy, and so on, in addition to the "everyday" formal and informal pronouns. Pronouns are also specialized for gender. In addition, there are constructions involving particles and other modifiers by which one can construct a sort of compound pronoun, making it very difficult to give a complete enumeration of pronouns in Thai. To give a better general idea for the possible pronouns, the table on Wikipedia in the "pronouns" section gives a list of pronouns which it says are "appropriate for conversational use".

Interestingly, Thai lacks clear word boundaries, like the spaces between words in English. Fluent speakers are able to identify words in a sentence without any consistent markers, although there are certain hints like the presence or absence of certain vowels in the first syllable of a word.

Demographics
------------

There are an estimated 20 million native speakers of Thai, and an additional 20 million speakers of closely related languages who have learned Standard Thai as a second language. The standardized language is that of Central Thailand, particularly Bangkok and the surrounding area. Other regions of Thailand each have their own closely related variants: examples include Isan, which is essentially a dialect of Lao with some Thai influence and written in the Thai script; Northern Thai, or Lanna, which is also very similar to Lao; Southern Thai; and Phu Thai.

Besides the various other languages in the Tai family, which constitute the variants described above, the Lao language is also mutually intelligible with Thai and shares a substantial part of its vocabulary, grammar, etc. The Khmer language has also been a substantial influence on Thai, being the main language of one of the countries neighboring Thailand.

This map shows the distribution of Thai speakers; the dark blue area indicates Standard Thai while the lighter blue indicates other closely related variants in the Tai family.

Script
------

Thai is written in its own left-to-right script, closely related to the Lao script and believed to be descended from the Khmer script. The script itself is considered to be an abugida, in which all consonants directly correspond to graphemes, but certain vowels are implied and others are written above or to the side of the consonants. Since the script is unique to the Thai language, which itself is not very widely spoken, the only major publications in the Thai script would likely be Thai-language newspapers and the like. There does not appear to be any issue of availability of keyboards; since the script only contains about twice as many characters as the Latin script, it is relatively straightforward to come up with a key mapping.

There is also a separate system of Thai numerals, which are widely used in place of the usual Arabic ones, especially in the context of measure words.

Machine translation
-------------------

Thai is a relatively large language as far as low-resource languages go, and Google Translate provides support for it. Here is a translated paragraph from a Thai Wikipedia article on the First Indochina War:

> Result of an error in the decision of France. The French began operating in support of its troops at Dien Bien Phu. Deep in the valley to the north of Vietnam. The purpose of this operation to cut off supplies to the Viet Minh into the Kingdom of Laos, a country neighbor and ally of France. And to draw the Viet Minh's epic showdown that will undermine the potential of the Viet Minh in tactical however Viet Minh under the command of Gen. emergency financial Henry Giap. French blockade The French do not know that Viet Minh with heavy artillery. Including anti-aircraft guns in their possession. As well as the ability of the Viet Minh to move such weapons through the rugged terrain to the top of the hill overlooking the stronghold of France. Viet Minh occupied the surrounding Dien Bien Phu and the French artillery bombarded the fort. It was the battle ground and stand up under it. Which is similar to trench warfare in World War One. French troops to repel the attack on the stronghold of the Viet Minh several times. Supplies and reinforcements were sent into the air. But were stopped Because the French were seized, and the loss of antiaircraft fire. Have fewer supplies to military action. After a two-month siege French strongholds have been seized and are mostly French surrendered. Only a minority can only have fled to Laos. French government to resign and a new prime minister Pierre Mans Adirondack post - France's left-wing center from the withdrawal of French troops from Indochina.

The effects of strict word ordering and lack of morphology can be seen in the relatively terse translated output that is often missing English morphological features. However, the translation is quite comprehensible overall.

The archive linked in the project description gives a fair number of research articles on Thai translation. The most interesting one considers Thai among [languages which lack clear word boundaries](http://www.mt-archive.info/00/LREC-2000-Potipiti.pdf), which obviously poses a significant problem for constructing machine translation systems. In a similar vein, one paper proposes a [syllable-based MT system](http://www.mt-archive.info/10/NEWS-2010-Wutiwiwatchai.pdf) for Thai to address shortcomings in identifying word boundaries. Another paper [considers the challenges in building a translation system for an analytic language](http://www.mt-archive.info/05/IJCNLP-2008-Boonkwan.pdf); an analytic language is one, like Thai, which entirely or almost entirely lacks morphological information. Several other papers consider Thai as part of research into low-resource languages in general.

There appears to be [a very small tree bank](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W09-3414) for Thai, but it appears that the amount of data would be insufficient for constructing a parser.
